This project was developed as a personal learning and demonstration tool

to translate ALCOA+ Data Integrity principles into practical, automated checks.



During development, AI-assisted tools were used as a support for:

\- code structuring

\- refactoring

\- documentation clarity



All design decisions, rule definitions, validation logic, and interpretation

of GMP/Data Integrity concepts were defined and validated by the author.



\## Downstream Usage



This tool can be used as a \*\*data integrity validation layer\*\*

before downstream processes such as:



\- Batch traceability

\- Mock recall simulations

\- Quality investigations

\- Audit data reviews



Only datasets that pass critical ALCOA+ rules should be used for

operational decision-making.
