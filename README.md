This project was developed as a personal learning and demonstration tool 

to translate ALCOA+ Data Integrity principles into practical, automated checks.



During development, AI-assisted tools were used as a support for:

\- code structuring

\- refactoring

\- documentation clarity



All design decisions, rule definitions, validation logic, and interpretation 

of GMP/Data Integrity concepts were defined and validated by the author.
